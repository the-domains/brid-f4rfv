            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>BioLite PowerLight Mini</h1><p>BioLite became leaders in the cooking and charging market thanks to their nifty wood burning CampStove (with portable grill) that generates electricity. For 2016, they now offer a lighter, battery-powered version called the CookStove for those who want an easy-to-start campfire but don't need the added perk of device-charging.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/15d26a5b3271b4a982292b69d0c6d641/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=758&cropwidth=1365&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F15f856f6fabecaf50bba4ce31970c8d387669f01.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Behind The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book's Brand New Update</h1><p>There are few cocktail guides with as much history as "The Old-Waldorf Astoria Bar Book" by Albert Stevens Crockett. The original source material, "Old Waldorf Bar Days" (1931), also by Crockett, was penned during Prohibition but the author rewrote it as we know it in 1933 when Prohibition ended.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c1d32105a54d9d89e483ba0384354f52d2dcf9ef.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

While single origin pour-overs are now commonplace in many coffeeshops, sometimes when you're off the beaten path, your morning cup of coffee is harder to perfect.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d979f42e1fe163d4ad2ae387a8da167c/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=861&cropwidth=1576&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fba000655e6b2a554855a55a3bfaa786ed97ccb09.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
